        <p>The women who sang during the  1930's through the early 1950's represent  a style of singing  that  was supplanted in later years by  upbeat doo wop, pounding defiant rock and roll of the 1960's and 1970's  and by the electronically modified techno pop of the 1980's.</p>
     </p>

        <p>Yet their sometimes sweet  and sometimes sultry voices have lasted through the decades to influence the music of modern singers like Amy Winehouse and Adele.  </p>
